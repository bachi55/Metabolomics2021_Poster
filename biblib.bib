  abstract      = {In nontarget screening, structure elucidation of small molecules from high resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) data is challenging, particularly the selection of the most likely candidate structure among the many retrieved from compound databases. Several fragmentation and retention prediction methods have been developed to improve this candidate selection. In order to evaluate their performance, we compared two in silico fragmenters (MetFrag and CFM-ID) and two retention time prediction models (based on the chromatographic hydrophobicity index (CHI) and on log D). A set of 78 known organic micropollutants was analyzed by liquid chromatography coupled to a LTQ Orbitrap HRMS with electrospray ionization (ESI) in positive and negative mode using two fragmentation techniques with different collision energies. Both fragmenters (MetFrag and CFM-ID) performed well for most compounds, with average ranking the correct candidate structure within the top 25{\%} and 22 to 37{\%} for ESI+ and ESI- mode, respectively. The rank of the correct candidate structure slightly improved when MetFrag and CFM-ID were combined. For unknown compounds detected in both ESI+ and ESI-, generally positive mode mass spectra were better for further structure elucidation. Both retention prediction models performed reasonably well for more hydrophobic compounds but not for early eluting hydrophilic substances. The log D prediction showed a better accuracy than the CHI model. Although the two fragmentation prediction methods are more diagnostic and sensitive for candidate selection, the inclusion of retention prediction by calculating a consensus score with optimized weighting can improve the ranking of correct candidates as compared to the individual methods.},

Furthermore, we show how a maximum-likelihood estimator of such a training objective can subsequently be used for prediction on the full graph. We present experimental results which improve on the state-of-the-art. Additionally, the training objective is less sensitive to the regularization than pseudo-likelihood based training approaches. We perform the experimental validation on two classes of data sets where structure is important: image denoising and multilabel classification.},

  abstract = {Abstract Metabolite identification is a crucial step in non-targeted metabolomics, but also represents one of its current bottlenecks. Accurate identifications are required for correct biological interpretation. To date, annotation and identification are usually based on the use of accurate mass search or tandem MS analysis, but neglect orthogonal information such as retention times obtained by chromatographic separation. While several tools are available for the analysis and prediction of tandem MS data, prediction of retention times for metabolite identification are not widespread. Here, we review the current state of retention time prediction in liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry-based metabolomics, with a focus on publications published after 2010.
